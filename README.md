### Picalculator
The aim of the problem is to approximate the transcendental number Pi using partial sums of two infinite series and numerical solution of the equation sin (x) = 0.

### BST (Binary Search Tree)
The goal of the task is to implement a data structure called a binary search tree. Unlike the (linear) link list, in this structure, each node can have up to two followers: the left and right nodes (see the figure on the right). The rule for creating new nodes is that the value of the left follower is always less than the value of the current node, and conversely the value of the right follower is always greater than the value in the current node. If the given node does not have non-follower (s), then the left / right / both references point to None.

### Calculator
Your task will be to create a full-fledged calculator.

### CarDB - Showroom
Your task is to create a simple database of cars. Use a linked list to implement. The car database has a method for creating it from a predefined field, a method for inserting a car into the db, a method for editing the name of an already inserted car, a method for editing the brand of an already inserted car and a method for changing the status of an already inserted car. For simplicity, it is not possible to change the price of the car. Furthermore, the database has a method that can calculate the total value of cars in the showroom. The database also has a method that returns the join list header, the join list itself, and a method that clears the database.

### Data Sorting
Your task is to create a sort.py file in which one of the sorting algorithms will be implemented, which has the STABLE property (stability). The aim of the task is to demonstrate general knowledge of sorting. In your solution, we will check the presence and functionality of two functions: sortNumbers and sortData.

### Dijkstra
Your tenth task is to implement Dijkstra's algorithm and use it to find the shortest path problem (SPT). You get the graph entered using structures (vertices and edges) with the proviso that the edges are positively evaluated and are oriented. There can be cycles in the graph.

### Permutation
The goal of the ninth task is to generate a list of all permutations of the given elements. Ie. for example for elements [1, 2, 3] return [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], 
[2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2 ], [3, 2, 1]].

### Polynom
The task is to create a polynom.py file, which contains three functions for basic operations with polynomials. Specifically, it is a calculation of the value of a polynomial, the sum of two polynomials and the product of two polynomials. We will represent polynomials in Python using the data type list. The sheet entries will be numbers of the float data type corresponding to the coefficients of the given polynomial. Let us define that the first item of the sheet with index zero will correspond to the coefficient for the constant term, the second to the coefficient for the linear term, the third to the coefficient for the quadratic term, etc.â€¦
